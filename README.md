## Key Features: -
Layoff Trends Over Time: Track layoffs from 2020 to the present, identifying key periods of job cuts.
Company-Level Insights: Explore layoffs at the company level, with details on the total number of employees affected and the percentage laid off.
Funding & Stage Analysis: Understand how companies' funding rounds and stages (e.g., Seed, Series A) correlate with layoffs.
Industry & Geographic Distribution: Review layoffs across various tech sub-sectors and geographic regions, including country-level breakdowns.
